v2020-12-17

# Deadlines
- submission of proposal for the concept: 2020-12-22T23:00. (See [ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
- submission for the entire project: One day before the official final date of the course at 23:00 by Moodle.

# Goal

Come up with an *impressive presentation* of a concept of your choice for a self learner,
which cannot be done with PowerPoint.
Use your imagination.

Similar to [Snapsvg](http://snapsvg.io/start/), 
develop an educational content, 
which contains both graphical and verbal description.
Explain the concept step by step by drawing on the black board 
as if you are physically doing the presentation in a class.
Show what we have learned in Dynamic Web.


# Description

- Select a relatively sophisticated concept, 
  which requires graphical description.
  In order to give an idea, 
  a list of possible concepts are given below, 
  but it is better if you find your own concept that you are familiar with.
  Do not spend time to learn the concept itself.
    - [How git works](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/)
    - How priority queue works
    - Visual description of graph algorithms
    - Pointers in C 
    - Vectors in Math/Physics
    - Motion in Physics
    - Financial concepts
    - Triangle drawings but not trivial ones such as "given three sides a, b, and c".
- Design how to explain the concept by means of [storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard).
- Implement your storyboard description step by step in single web page.


# Specification

- The graphical description should be in svg.
  The verbal description should be in html.
- There is a need of a minimum navigation system,
  which enables `forward` and `backward` move within the page.
- You are not allowed to use multiple pages. 
  It has to be a single-web page.
- You are not allowed to use any javascript libraries. 
  The only except is [snapsvg](http://snapsvg.io/).
  

# Bonus points

- (10%)
  Learner needs to know how many more steps to the end. 
  There are many ways to show that such as a progress bar.
  Note that a simple non-graphical solution 
  such as "`step-you-are-in` out of `the-number-of-steps`" 
  does not count.
- (20%)
  Direct access to any step from any other as in the case
  of [Snapsvg](http://snapsvg.io/start/).
